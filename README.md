## PRACTICE - DIFFERENT AI APPROACHES ON TIC TAC TOE

I am using this project to practice and learn AI on Tic-Tac-Toe game

Three agents are now available and work:
- Monte Carlo Tree Search Agent
- Minimax Agent
- Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning Agent

Before you take a look at the code please know:
- code is written in a hurry
- code is written trough learning about AI
- there are some unused parts of code
- code is ugly
- don't fork this
- someday, maybe, code will be written well and be used as a learning example, that's not the situation right now
- there are no installation and how to use instructions
- there is 0 commit history
- don't judge
